## **Learning Objectives – PostgreSQL & Supabase**

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

---

## **1. Understand the Role of Databases in Backend Systems**

- Explain why backend applications require persistent data storage
- Understand the limitations of in-memory data
- Identify databases as the backbone of backend systems
- Relate backend APIs to data being stored and retrieved from a database

---

## **2. Understand Relational Databases and SQL**

- Define a **relational database**

- Explain how data is organised using:

  - Tables
  - Rows
  - Columns

- Understand SQL as a language used to:

  - Store data
  - Retrieve data
  - Modify data

- Recognize **PostgreSQL** as a popular relational database used in industry

---

## **3. Understand Why Supabase Is Used Instead of Local PostgreSQL Setup**

- Identify challenges with local PostgreSQL installation for beginners

- Understand **Supabase** as:

  - A hosted PostgreSQL database
  - A developer-friendly database interface

- Clearly understand that:

  - Supabase is used **only as a database platform**
  - No backend logic is involved in this session

---

## **4. Setup and Navigate a Supabase Project**

- Create a Supabase project
- Navigate the Supabase dashboard confidently
- Access and use the SQL Editor
- Understand where tables and data live inside Supabase

---

## **5. Create Tables Using SQL**

- Write SQL queries to create tables
- Define columns with appropriate data types
- Understand the role of a primary key
- Relate table structure to real-world data models

---

## **6. Perform Basic CRUD Operations Using SQL**

- Insert data using `INSERT`
- Retrieve data using `SELECT`
- Update data using `UPDATE`
- Delete data using `DELETE`
- Execute and verify queries directly in Supabase

---

## **7. Understand the Flow of Data Without Backend Code**

- Understand that data can be managed without Node.js initially
- Recognize Supabase as a **database interface**, not an API server
- Prepare mentally for backend integration in later sessions

---

## **End-of-Session Outcome**

By the end of this session, students will:

- Clearly understand what a relational database is
- Write and execute basic SQL queries
- Use Supabase confidently as a PostgreSQL environment
- Perform CRUD operations without backend code
- Be ready to explore advanced queries and relationships in the next session
