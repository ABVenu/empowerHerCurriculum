## üåê Transition: From Computers & Internet ‚Üí Online Apps

We began our journey with **computers** ‚Äì machines that changed how we live and work. Then, we explored the **internet** ‚Äì the network that gave life to computers, connecting them to the entire world.

Now comes the **third stage**: Online Apps.

These apps are not installed on your computer. They run directly on the internet. You just need a browser and a Google account. They are:

* **Free to use**
* **Always updated** (no need to install new versions)
* **Accessible anywhere** (mobile, laptop, office, home)
* **Collaborative** (many people can work on the same file at the same time)

üëâ Today‚Äôs professionals don‚Äôt just use their *core tools* (for example, a software developer doesn‚Äôt just code). They also need these **digital essentials** to:

* Maintain their tasks and notes
* Present ideas and designs
* Schedule and attend meetings
* Upload, share, and secure important files

This is why **Google Apps** are considered *must-have skills* for every working professional.

## 1. Google Drive ‚Äì Your Online Hard Disk

![Google Drive](https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/458dbd3f-9e8c-4b55-b73f-9a2d344dffec/TClAMjwzWdGliILh.png)

Think of Google Drive as your **personal hard disk in the cloud**.

* Every Google account comes with **15 GB free storage space**.
* You can create folders, upload files, and share them just like on your computer.
* The big difference: your files are **safe online**. Even if your laptop crashes or your phone is lost, your data is still accessible from anywhere.

üí° **Why Professionals Use Drive**
In corporate and technical roles, people constantly use Drive to:

* Store resumes, reports, and presentations
* Share project files with teams
* Keep personal + professional documents safe in one place

**Demo:**

* Show how to create a new folder.
* Upload a file and move it inside a folder.
* Explain file organization (naming, sub-folders).

**Student Activity (2 mins):**

* Create a folder in your Drive called **‚ÄúSession 3 Practice‚Äù**.

   * Then, turn on **‚ÄúAnyone with link can view‚Äù** sharing.
   * Ask them to refresh and check again.
   * Lesson: Whenever you submit an assignment, **keep sharing ON**, or else it‚Äôs as good as *not submitted*. You may even get **zero marks**.

### Google Photos

* Backs up photos automatically if sync is ON.
* Even if your mobile is lost, your memories are safe.
* You can upload photos from computer, share with friends, and remove sharing anytime.
* Eliminates the need for pen drives or insecure transfers.

#### **Where is Markdown Used?**

- **GitHub**: For README files and documentation of software projects.
- **Blogs**: Platforms like Ghost and Jekyll use Markdown for writing posts.
- **Technical Documentation**: Used in wikis, APIs, and manuals.
- **Note-taking**: Useful for personal notes, especially in apps like Notion or Obsidian.

---

### **Importance of Markdown in Computer Documentation**

- **Readable and Portable**: Markdown files are plain text, making them easy to share across platforms.
- **Widely Supported**: Many websites and tools support Markdown (e.g., GitHub, Slack).
- **Easy to Learn**: Minimal syntax, focusing on what‚Äôs essential (headers, lists, links, etc.).
- **Ideal for Collaboration**: Developers and writers can quickly create structured content in teams without worrying about complex formatting.

## 8. Touch Typing ‚Äì Speed & Confidence

Touch typing is a **method of typing without looking at the keyboard**. It improves both typing speed and accuracy over time.
![Intro To Typing](https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/0b1f618c-1cf3-4fb3-bfb7-ef601d311a89/CloVOBvbSOsPQyHP.png)

#### **Why Learn Touch Typing?**

- **Efficiency**: Saves time, especially when typing long documents or emails.
- **Accuracy**: Reduces errors when you don‚Äôt need to look at the keyboard.
- **Ergonomics**: Encourages proper posture, reducing strain on hands and wrists.
- **Essential for Coding**: Helps developers focus on code logic without distraction.

---

### **How to Touch Type**

1. **Hand Placement (Home Row Keys)**
   - Left hand: A, S, D, F
   - Right hand: J, K, L, ;
   - Thumbs rest on the **spacebar**.

![Ideal Placement Of Fingers](https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/de53bd2b-a52a-4a28-ae64-6011ed8ddfeb/a2zkAuIdX3qm0Al2.png)


2. **Posture and Ergonomics**

   - Sit up straight with both feet flat on the floor.
   - Keep your wrists elevated, not resting on the keyboard.
   - Maintain relaxed shoulders and a slight bend in your elbows.

3. **Typing Tips**
   - Start slow: Focus on accuracy first, then work on increasing speed.
   - Avoid looking at the keyboard: If you make mistakes, try to correct them without looking.
   - Practice every day for a few minutes to build muscle memory.
![Ideal Placement Of Fingers](https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/fee52013-0b50-49f1-b1d9-f42a87274f20/DODnirMffPSQ2sCC.png)
### **Hands-On Typing Practice**

1. Go to [Ratatype](https://www.ratatype.com/) or [Monkey Type](https://monkeytype.com/) or any other typing website.
2. Take the initial **typing test** to evaluate your current typing speed and accuracy.
3. Follow the lessons:
   - Start with the **home row keys** until you feel comfortable.
   - Progress to using **all fingers** for typing sentences.
4. Set a goal:
   - Aim to type at least **20 words per minute (WPM)** with 90% accuracy initially.
   - Gradually improve both speed and accuracy with daily practice.
### üñ•Ô∏è General Guidelines for Typing Speed

* **Beginner / Student** ‚Üí **20‚Äì30 WPM** (words per minute)
* **Average User** ‚Üí **35‚Äì45 WPM**
* **Good Professional Speed** ‚Üí **50‚Äì65 WPM**
* **Fast & Efficient Professional** ‚Üí **65‚Äì80 WPM**
* **Expert / Competitive Typist** ‚Üí **90+ WPM**

---

### üë©‚Äçüíª Recommended for Professionals & Developers

For students preparing for jobs or working in technical fields (like programming, documentation, or business roles):

* **Ideal recommended speed:** **60‚Äì70 WPM**
* **Accuracy goal:** **95%+** (speed without accuracy is meaningless)

This level ensures:

* You can code, write mails, and prepare documents quickly.
* You keep up with professional tasks without ‚Äúkeyboard lag‚Äù.
* You save hours of time in the long run.

---

üí° Fun fact: The **world record** is over **200 WPM**, but for daily professional life, even **60‚Äì70 WPM with high accuracy** makes you look *very efficient and confident*.
