### **2. Basic Mathematical Operations (35 minutes)**

#### **A. Arithmetic Operations**

**Why:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus are the foundations of all calculations in real life, such as budgeting, shopping, and measuring.

**Examples:**

1. 45 + 32 = 77
2. 120 + 350 = 470
3. 90 − 55 = 35
4. 500 − 275 = 225
5. 7 × 8 = 56
6. 25 × 12 = 300
7. 56 ÷ 7 = 8
8. 225 ÷ 15 = 15

---

#### **B. Squares, Square Roots, Cubes, Cube Roots**

**Why:** Squares, roots, and cubes help in calculating areas, volumes, growth rates, and many scientific problems.

**Formulas:**

- Square: $S = a^2$
- Square root: $a = \sqrt{S}$
- Cube: $V = a^3$
- Cube root: $a = \sqrt[3]{V}$

**Examples:**

1. 5² = 25
2. 12² = 144
3. √36 = 6
4. √196 = 14
5. 3³ = 27
6. 5³ = 125
7. ∛27 = 3
8. ∛125 = 5

---

#### **C. Areas & Volumes of Basic Shapes**

**Why:** Calculating areas and volumes is useful in construction, packaging, interior designing, and daily measurement tasks.

**Formulas:**

| Shape     | Formula               |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Rectangle | Area = l × b          |
| Square    | Area = a²             |
| Triangle  | Area = ½ × b × h      |
| Circle    | Area = π × r²         |
| Cube      | Volume = a³           |
| Cuboid    | Volume = l × b × h    |
| Cylinder  | Volume = π × r² × h   |
| Sphere    | Volume = 4/3 × π × r³ |

**Examples:**

1. Rectangle: l=8, b=5 → 8×5=40
2. Square: a=7 → 7²=49
3. Triangle: b=10, h=5 → ½×10×5=25
4. Circle: r=3 → π×3² ≈ 28.27
5. Cube: a=6 → 6³=216
6. Cuboid: l=5, b=4, h=3 → 5×4×3=60
7. Cylinder: r=7, h=10 → π×7²×10 ≈ 1539.38
8. Sphere: r=6 → 4/3×π×6³ ≈ 904.78

---

#### **D. Ratios & Proportions**

**Why:** Ratios and proportions are important for **mixing ingredients, dividing resources, and comparing quantities**.

**Formula:**

- Ratio = a : b
- Proportion: $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$

**Examples:**

1. Pens : Pencils = 2:5
2. Boys : Girls = 3:4
3. Apples : Oranges = 8:12
4. If 2/3 = x/9 → x = 6
5. 4/5 = y/20 → y = 16
6. Red:Blue balls = 7:3
7. Paint mixture: 2 parts red, 3 yellow, 10L → red=4L, yellow=6L
8. 5/8 = z/32 → z = 20

---

#### **E. Discounts & Markups**

**Why:** Discounts and markups are essential in shopping, business pricing, and profit calculations.

**Formulas:**

- Discount = Cost Price × (Discount % /100)
- Selling Price = Cost Price − Discount
- Markup = Cost Price × (Markup % /100)
- Selling Price = Cost Price + Markup

**Examples:**

1. ₹800, discount 25% → ₹800−200=₹600
2. ₹400, markup 15% → ₹400+60=₹460
3. 3 notebooks ₹50 each, 10% discount → 3×50=150, 150−15=135
4. Dress ₹1200, 20% off → 1200−240=960
5. Shoes ₹2000, 30% discount → 2000−600=1400
6. Cost Price ₹350, markup 20% → 350+70=420
7. Grocery ₹1500, 5% discount → 1500−75=1425
8. Laptop ₹50,000, 10% discount → 50,000−5000=45,000

---

#### **F. Averages**

**Why:** Averages help **summarize data and make comparisons**, used in academics, sales, and statistics.

**Formula:**

- Average = Sum of terms / Number of terms

**Examples:**

1. Scores: 70, 80, 90 → (70+80+90)/3=80
2. Weighted: 85×2 + 90×3 → (170+270)/5=88
3. Marks: 50, 60, 70, 80 → (50+60+70+80)/4=65
4. Expenses: 1200, 1500, 1300 → (1200+1500+1300)/3=1333.33
5. Test Scores: 45,55,65,75,85 → 65
6. Weighted: 70×2+80×3+90×5 → (140+240+450)/10=84
7. Weekly sales: 10,15,20,25,30 → 20
8. Student heights: 150,155,160,165,170 → 160

---

#### **G. Units Conversion**

**Why:** Units conversion is necessary in **travel, cooking, science, and commerce**.

**Examples:**

1. 5 km → 5000 m
2. 2.5 m → 250 cm
3. 3 L → 3000 mL
4. 750 mL → 0.75 L
5. 10 km/h → 2.78 m/s
6. 500 g → 0.5 kg
7. 2500 m → 2.5 km
8. 3 hours → 180 minutes

---

### **3. Daily Life Implementation (Examples)**

- Budgeting, shopping, cooking, travel, savings
- Example: Travel 300 km, mileage 15 km/l, fuel ₹100/l → Fuel = 300/15=20L → Cost=₹2000
