## 🔄 Recap & Smooth Transition

Last time, we saw how computers made life smarter — writing, calculations, games, music.

But let’s travel back to the early 2000s. Suppose you wanted to watch a movie released in 2005. What would you do? A friend might give it to you on a CD or pendrive. You’d copy it to your computer and then play it.

Now, in 2025, things are completely different. You just open Netflix or YouTube and start watching instantly.

👉 What made this leap possible? The **Internet**.
Computers became truly powerful only when they were connected to the Internet.

**Activity 1 (Icebreaker):** Ask students — *“If you had a computer but no Internet, what’s the one thing you would miss most?”* Collect 3–4 responses (e.g., YouTube, WhatsApp, Google).

## 🌍 Life Before the Internet

Life before the Internet was slower and more manual:

* **Communication:** Letters, telegrams, landline phones.
* **Learning:** Libraries, encyclopedias, newspapers.
* **Shopping:** Local markets, no home delivery.
* **Travel:** Long queues at railway counters.
* **Banking:** Cash, cheques, passbooks.

Computers were like **powerful notebooks** — useful, but disconnected from the world. The Internet connected them and unlocked their true potential.

**Activity 2:** Show two images side by side: a telegram vs WhatsApp. Ask — *“Which would you prefer and why?”*

## 🚀 What Exactly is the Internet?

The Internet is a **global network of networks**.

* Think of it like a **giant highway system**.

  * Roads = cables.
  * Vehicles = data packets.
  * Cities = computers/devices.

This highway connects billions of devices — phones, laptops, servers, and now even smart TVs and fridges.

## 🔌 How the Internet Works (The Hidden World)

Let’s uncover what happens when you click on a website.

1. **Optical Fiber Cables:**
   Most Internet traffic flows through underground and undersea **optical fiber cables**. These thin glass fibers carry data as light pulses. A single strand can carry thousands of HD movies every second!

   👉 Fun fact: 99% of international Internet traffic goes through these submarine cables lying quietly at the bottom of the ocean.

2. **Satellites:**
   In remote areas like mountains or villages where cables can’t reach, Internet comes via satellites. New constellations (like Starlink) even bring broadband to airplanes and ships.

3. **Routers & ISPs:**
   Your Internet Service Provider (Airtel, Jio, BSNL) delivers this data to your home via mobile towers or broadband lines. A router then connects your device.

4. **Behind the Scenes (Example):**
   When you type `www.youtube.com`:

   * Your browser asks a DNS server for YouTube’s IP address.
   * The request travels through your router, ISP, and across international cables.
   * YouTube’s server sends back data packets.
   * Your browser assembles these into the page you see.

👉 All this happens in less than a second!

**Activity 3:** Play “roleplay Internet.” Choose 3–4 students as: Browser, DNS, Server, Router. Make them act out how a request flows.

## 📖 A Short History of the Internet

* **1960s–70s:** ARPANET — a U.S. military experiment.

## 🇮🇳 The Internet in India

* **1995:** Internet launched in India by VSNL — slow, expensive, limited.
* **2000s:** Cyber cafes became popular. Families would go together to send emails.
* **2016:** Reliance Jio offered cheap data — Internet usage exploded.
* **Today (2025):**

  * **900 million users** in India (2nd largest in the world).
  * Internet in villages is rapidly growing.
  * India leads in **digital payments (UPI)** and cheapest mobile data globally.

👉 Internet in India is not just a tool — it’s a **revolution** that changed education, business, and social life.

**Activity 4:** Ask students — *“Does your family use the Internet for payments (UPI)? For what purposes?”*

## 📊 The Internet Across the World

* In 2000: only **7% of the world** had Internet.
* In 2025: over **5.5 billion people** (70% of humanity) are online.
* Some countries (like South Korea) have almost **100% penetration**.

This means more than half the planet is connected, like one giant community.

## 💰 Internet and the Global Economy

The Internet is not just social media — it is the **engine of today’s economy**.

* **E-commerce:** Amazon, Flipkart, Alibaba = trillions in sales.
* **Digital Payments:** PayPal, Google Pay, UPI = cashless future.
* **Jobs & Freelancing:** Millions working remotely worldwide.
* **Startups:** Unicorns like Ola, Swiggy, Zomato exist only because of Internet.

The World Bank notes: **every 10% rise in Internet access → major boost to GDP.**

👉 In simple terms: **Internet = Jobs + Money + Opportunities.**

**Activity 5:** Quick class poll — *“How many of you know someone earning money because of the Internet (YouTuber, freelancer, remote worker, online seller)?”*
