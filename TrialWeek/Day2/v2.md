## 🏁 Quick Recap from Session 1

* In the Last session, we saw how **computers made life smarter and easier**.
* But computers alone were limited to offline tasks like typing in Word, using Paint, or playing games.
* Example Story: In 2005, if you wanted to watch a movie, a friend had to give you a CD or pendrive.
* In 2025, you just open YouTube or Netflix and stream instantly.
  👉 Why this difference? Because of the **Internet**.

**Which means Computer may be smarter, but Internet adds Life to the computer**
>*Computer without Internet is like Sambar without salt, Icecream without sweetness*

**So today, let’s explore how the Internet changed everything.**

---

## 1. Life Before the Internet

* People depended on traditional systems:

  * **Communication:** Letters, telegrams, landlines.
  * **Learning:** Libraries, encyclopedias, newspapers.
  * **Shopping:** Local markets, physical stores.
  * **Travel:** Standing in railway queues.
  * **Banking:** Cash, cheques, passbooks.
* Computers were powerful but limited to **offline tasks**.

👉 **Key Point:** The Internet transformed computers from **isolated machines** into **global connectors**.

**Activity:** Ask students – *“How do you think people booked train tickets before IRCTC?”*

---

## 2. What is the Internet?

* Internet = a **global network of networks** connecting millions of devices.
* **Analogy:**

  * Internet = Highways.
  * Devices & websites = Vehicles traveling on them.

👉 Important terms:

* **Internet:** Physical infrastructure (cables, routers, satellites).
* **Intranet:** Private restricted network (e.g., school LAN).
* **Why powerful?** Enables **instant sharing of information worldwide**.

---

## 3. How the Internet Works (The Real Story)

### 💡 Illusion of Wireless

* We feel Internet is “wireless” because of Wi-Fi and mobile data.
* Reality: Only the **last step (device → tower/router)** is wireless.
* The **backbone of the Internet is wired** (optical fiber cables, undersea cables).

Let’s uncover what happens when you click on a website.

1. **Optical Fiber Cables:**
   Most Internet traffic flows through underground and undersea **optical fiber cables**. These thin glass fibers carry data as light pulses. A single strand can carry thousands of HD movies every second!

   👉 Fun fact: 99% of international Internet traffic goes through these submarine cables lying quietly at the bottom of the ocean.

2. **Satellites:**
   In remote areas like mountains or villages where cables can’t reach, Internet comes via satellites. New constellations (like Starlink) even bring broadband to airplanes and ships.

3. **Routers & ISPs:**
   Your Internet Service Provider (Airtel, Jio, BSNL) delivers this data to your home via mobile towers or broadband lines. A router then connects your device.
---

4. **Behind the Scenes (Example):**
   - When you type `www.youtube.com` in browser/app.
   - Device connects **wirelessly** to nearby Wi-Fi router or cell tower.
   - Router/tower is connected by **optical fiber cables** to ISP (Jio, Airtel, BSNL).
   - Data travels via **underground & undersea cables** (light signals through fiber).
   - It Reaches YouTube’s **data center (server warehouses)**.
   - Server sends back video in **data packets**.
    - Data Packets return via same path and finally displayed in Browser/Screen.
   -  these long journey happens within milliseconds many times if you click much more buttons/watch much more videos.
   - Yes, the time taken is milliseconds because, the data travels approximately speed of light!!!

👉 Analogy Recap:

* Device ↔ Tower = Wireless (like Bluetooth).
* Backbone cables = Highways of light.
* Routers = Traffic police.
* Servers = Restaurants serving your order.
* Data packets = Pizza slices delivered to you.

## 📖 A Short History of the Internet

* **1960s–70s:** ARPANET — a U.S. military experiment.
* **1980s:** Spread to universities for research.
* **1990s:** Tim Berners-Lee invented the **World Wide Web**. First websites appeared.
* **2000s:** Broadband → faster Internet, social media boom.
* **2010s:** 4G + smartphones → Internet in everyone’s pocket.
* **2020s:** 5G, AI, IoT → Internet everywhere, even in watches and cars.
### 📶 India’s Internet Backbone

* **Submarine Cables Land in India at:**

  * Mumbai (connects Europe & Middle East).
  * Chennai (connects Southeast Asia).
  * Kochi (connects Middle East).
  * Tuticorin (connects Singapore).
* From landing stations → cables spread nationwide via **BharatNet & private ISPs**.
* Towers, Wi-Fi, and local ISPs bring it to homes and mobiles.

👉 **Activity:** Visit [submarinecablemap.com](https://www.submarinecablemap.com) and trace a cable route into India.
### 🇮🇳 The Internet in India

* **1995:** Internet launched in India by VSNL — slow, expensive, limited.
* **2000s:** Cyber cafes became popular. Families would go together to send emails.
* **2016:** Reliance Jio offered cheap data — Internet usage exploded.
* **Today (2025):**

  * **900 million users** in India (2nd largest in the world).
  * Internet in villages is rapidly growing.
  * India leads in **digital payments (UPI)** and cheapest mobile data globally.

👉 Internet in India is not just a tool — it’s a **revolution** that changed education, business, and social life.

**Activity 4:** Ask students — *“Does your family use the Internet for payments (UPI)? For what purposes?”*

---
## 📊 The Internet Across the World

* In 2000: only **7% of the world** had Internet.
* In 2025: over **5.5 billion people** (70% of humanity) are online.
* Some countries (like South Korea) have almost **100% penetration**.

This means more than half the planet is connected, like one giant community.

---

## 💰 Internet and the Global Economy

The Internet is not just social media — it is the **engine of today’s economy**.

* **E-commerce:** Amazon, Flipkart, Alibaba = trillions in sales.
* **Digital Payments:** PayPal, Google Pay, UPI = cashless future.
* **Jobs & Freelancing:** Millions working remotely worldwide.
* **Startups:** Unicorns like Ola, Swiggy, Zomato exist only because of Internet.

The World Bank notes: **every 10% rise in Internet access → major boost to GDP.**

👉 In simple terms: **Internet = Jobs + Money + Opportunities.**

**Activity 5:** Quick class poll — *“How many of you know someone earning money because of the Internet (YouTuber, freelancer, remote worker, online seller)?”*

---

## 💡 Everyday Connection

Think about this very session. We are using Zoom, connected in real time. Data packets are flying across optical fibers and satellites so we can see and hear each other instantly.

The Internet has made the world feel like one big classroom.

---
### 🛰️ Satellites – Special Case

* For mountains, deserts, or oceans where cables can’t reach → satellites provide Internet.
* Example: **Starlink (Elon Musk)** → thousands of small satellites directly beam Internet to receivers.
* Advantage: Access everywhere.
* Limitation: Expensive, slower than fiber.

👉 Activity Question: *“If you are stuck on a ship in the ocean, which Internet will you use?”*

---

### 🏢 Data Centers & Servers

* YouTube, Google, Amazon use **huge server farms** called data centers.
* Handle **millions of requests per second**.
* Need powerful **cooling systems** (chilled water, AI-based airflow).
* Experimental **underwater data centers** (e.g., Microsoft Project Natick) use seawater for natural cooling.

👉 Curiosity Hook: *“Your YouTube video might be coming from a server cooled under the ocean!”*
