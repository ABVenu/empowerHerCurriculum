## 0. Icebreaker: A Day in Your Life

- **Think**: _‚ÄúWhat is the first thing you did today that involved a computer or mobile?‚Äù_
- **Reflect**: Pause for a moment and consider your morning routine. Did you check a message, set an alarm, listen to music, or read the news? All these actions rely on computers. Life today is so intertwined with technology that we often don't even realize how dependent we are on these subtle but powerful devices. From messaging a friend to paying for your coffee, computers are the hidden engines that make our modern world run smoothly.

## 1. Travel Back in Time ‚Äì Life Without Computers (1980s/1990s)

To truly appreciate the convenience of today, let's step back in time. Before the widespread use of personal computers, most daily tasks were **manual, slow, costly, and repetitive**. The simple actions we take for granted now required a lot of time, effort, and sometimes, long queues.

**Examples**:

- **Sending Money** ‚Üí To transfer money, you had to physically go to a bank, fill out a form, and the transfer could take several days to complete. There was no real-time tracking or instant assurance. The process was slow and often involved waiting in long lines.

**Mini-Activity**: Think of your grandparents' stories or old movies. What other everyday tasks were tedious in the 80s/90s? (e.g., paying utility bills, finding a job, shopping for groceries, scheduling a doctor's appointment).

üìå **Conclusion**: Without computers, our lives were defined by **manual labor, repetition, high costs, and slow processes**.

## 2. Life Without vs. With Computers ‚Äì A Moment of Reflection

Computers are no longer just tools for a specific group of people. They are an **integral part of life** for everyone‚Äîfrom children learning to code to elders using video calls to talk to their family. They have seamlessly integrated into our daily routines, making everything from a simple task to a complex project more manageable.

**Transition Question**: _‚ÄúBut how do computers, which are just machines, really work to make all this happen?‚Äù_

## 4. The Main Parts of a Computer: Understanding the Building Blocks

At its core, every computer, no matter how small, follows a simple model: **Input, Processing, Output, and Storage**. Think of these as the brain, eyes, hands, and memory of the machine.

1. **Input Devices**: These are the "eyes and ears" of the computer. They are used to feed data or commands into the system. **Examples**: Keyboard (typing), mouse (pointing), microphone (voice), scanner (images).

   <img src="https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/7cd91e7a-0dfd-4336-8a1d-a2bc1549f010/bEO1ieKpAtBzOpVV.png" width="300px" />

2. **Output Devices**: These are the computer's "hands and voice." They display or provide the result of the processing. **Examples**: Monitor (screen), printer (paper), speakers (sound), the screen on your phone showing an email.

   <img src="https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/84cb15c9-a2f2-4893-a6d6-d0c8f678aaca/anaRxyc3ilasYCpw.png" width="300px" />

3. **Storage Devices**: This is the computer's "memory." They store data and information for future use. **Examples**: Hard Disk Drive (HDD), Solid State Drive (SSD), USB Flash Drive, or Cloud Drive (like Google Drive).

   <img src="https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/99f734ab-758b-4ff6-98a3-b312a3aa6859/e2MTUuJMcUuhuEhd.webp" width="300px" />

4. **Processing Unit**: This is the "brain" of the computer. It performs all the calculations and logical operations. **Examples**: Central Processing Unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM), motherboard, and the power supply.

   <img src="https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/987604b1-e063-40cd-809d-d8afdc31ef00/axuiYtlDiFYNQMHr.png" width="300px" />

**How they work together**: You give a command using an **input device** (e.g., typing 'Hello' on a keyboard). The **processing unit** (CPU) processes this command using its short-term memory (RAM). The result is then displayed on an **output device** (e.g., the word 'Hello' appears on the monitor). You can then use a **storage device** to save this work. <img src="https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/824c97c5-4beb-455d-ad36-ab4c8bb9581b/dcpzuT23tUw1wah2.png" width="300px" />

## 5. How Computers Work: The IPO + Storage Model

Let's use simple analogies to understand this Input-Process-Output (IPO) model.

**Analogy 1: The Calculator**

- **Input**: You press the buttons `5`, `+`, and `3`. These are the inputs.
- **Process**: The internal circuits of the calculator (the CPU) perform the addition.
- **Output**: The number `8` is displayed on the screen.
- **Storage**: The calculator might temporarily "remember" the previous result in its memory.

  <img src="https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/d6d7f07a-5106-4c8e-a5d9-f388d5ac015a/BwgOyF0USKGvHflM.png" width="300px" />

**Analogy 2: ATM Withdrawal**

- **Input**: You insert your card and enter your PIN.
- **Process**: The ATM connects to the bank's server. The server verifies your PIN and checks your account balance.
- **Output**: The ATM dispenses the cash and prints a receipt.
- **Storage**: The bank's server updates your account balance and stores the transaction details.

  <img src="https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/3843b35c-756c-4c4d-beb8-077eb9cb0396/sDYJzycvpAJGsC3D.png" width="300px" />

**More examples**: Sending a WhatsApp message, playing music on your phone, or printing a document all follow this same basic model.

**Fun Analogy 4: Sandwich Making**

- **Ingredients** = Input (bread, cheese, veggies)
- **Chef** = Process (the chef follows the recipe and combines the ingredients)
- **Ready sandwich** = Output (the final product you eat)
- **Recipe/leftovers** = Storage (the recipe can be used again, and any leftover ingredients can be saved)

**Mini-Activity**: Identify the input, process, output, and storage in a daily task of your choice, like playing a video game or ordering food online.

## 6. Types of Computers & Devices

The term "computer" doesn't just mean a desktop tower and monitor. A computer is **any device capable of computation**, meaning it can take input, process it, and provide an output.

| Type                 | Examples                  | Use                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Desktop**          | Office PCs, gaming rigs   | A powerful and stationary workstation, often with a separate monitor, keyboard, and mouse.                           |
| **Laptop**           | Notebooks, MacBooks       | A portable computer with a built-in screen and keyboard, ideal for students and remote workers.                      |
| **Tablet**           | iPad, Samsung Tab         | A portable device with a touch screen, great for reading, drawing, or entertainment.                                 |
| **Smartphone**       | iPhone, Android phones    | A pocket-sized mini-computer we all carry, used for communication, internet, and much more.                          |
| **Servers**          | Computers in data centers | Powerful machines that run websites, store data, and power online services for millions of people.                   |
| **Embedded Systems** | ATM, microwave, smart car | Specialized computers built into larger devices to perform a specific function, giving them "built-in intelligence." |

<img src="https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/c1ea64ad-0516-4d73-bc2c-e85e15d763cc/XnwWpWQbYxnsmXQh.png" width="300px" />

**Activity**: Think about your own smartphone or a microwave. What are the input, output, and processing units in those devices?

## 7. Hardware vs. Software: The Brains and the Body

A computer system is made of two main parts that work together:

| Hardware                                                                                | Software                                                                  |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Physical, touchable parts** you can see and feel, like the screen, keyboard, and CPU. | **Code-based, invisible instructions** that tell the hardware what to do. |
| **Examples**: CPU, keyboard, monitor, mouse, speakers.                                  | **Examples**: MS Word, Chrome web browser, Windows Operating System.      |

üìå **Note**: Hardware is the body, and software is the brain. Software gives **instructions** to the hardware to perform a task. Our upcoming sessions will dive deeper into how this **software** is created.
