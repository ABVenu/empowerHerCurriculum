---

## 🔹 Flow of the Session

### 0. Icebreaker (2–3 mins)

- Ask: _“What is the first thing you did today that involved a computer or a mobile?”_
- Collect 2–3 answers → connect to how life depends on computers.

### 1. ✈️ Travel Back in Time – Life Without Computers (15 mins)

- **Storytelling mode**: Go to **1980s/1990s**.

  - _Task 1_: Sending Money → Had to visit bank branch, wait days, no assurance.

- _Task 2_: Sending Urgent Message → Telegraph, costly, time-taking.

![Telegram Service In 1980s](https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/e0182fb8-4d6f-4c08-9e13-e7ecc84e5806/X3IfVyFKihtfedRo.png)

- _Task 3_: Booking Train Ticket → Visit counter, no clarity on availability, long queues.

**Mini-Activity**:
👉 Ask students to list _other tasks that were tedious in 80s/90s_ (bill payment, job search, shopping, medical appointments).

📌 **Conclusion**: Everything was **manual, slow, costly, repetitive**.

**Fast-Forward to 2025**: Same tasks (money transfer, train booking, sending a message) are now **instant, cheaper, reliable, and assured**.
