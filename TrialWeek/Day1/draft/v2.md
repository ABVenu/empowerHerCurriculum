### 3. 🖥️ Main Parts of a Computer (10 mins)
[Added By Me Start]
- categorise the parts like computimng devices, input, output storage
- why these parts needed and how they are interlinked
[Added By Me End]
Break into **3 categories**:

1. **Input Devices** – Keyboard, Mouse, Touchscreen, Microphone, Scanner
2. **Output Devices** – Monitor, Printer, Speaker, Email Message
3. **Storage Devices** – Hard Drive, SSD, Pen Drive, Cloud (Google Drive)

Also introduce:

* **CPU (Processor)** – the brain that processes tasks
* **RAM** – temporary memory while programs run
* **Motherboard** – main board connecting all parts
* **Power Supply** – gives electricity to the system

### 4. 🔄 How a Computer Works (10–12 mins)

Use **IPO Model** (Input → Process → Output) + Storage
Explain with real-world example: taking a photo, typing a message, printing a form.

| Step    | Device Example               | Task Example             |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Input   | Keyboard, Mouse, Touchscreen | Type a message           |
| Process | CPU (with help of RAM)       | Spell check, formatting  |
| Output  | Monitor, Printer, Email      | Display message or print |
| Storage | Hard Disk, USB, Google Drive | Save the document        |

[Added By Me Start]
- Also elaborate processor in the best possible way, so that ant non technical person will also should get that
- Give the example of calculator, clearly explain what is i/p, o/p, storage and computation (which remains same)
- Add another one or two examples, ask students to identify the i/p, o/p, storage etc
  - Printing a letter
  - Taking cash from ATM
  - Sending message in whatsapp
  - playing a music
[Added By Me End]

🎯 Analogy: **Making a sandwich**
Input = ingredients, Process = preparing, Output = eating, Storage = leftovers packed.
