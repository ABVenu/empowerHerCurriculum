### 4. 🔄 How a Computer Works (10–12 mins)

Use **IPO Model** (Input → Process → Output) + Storage
Explain with real-world example: taking a photo, typing a message, printing a form.

| Step    | Device Example               | Task Example             |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Input   | Keyboard, Mouse, Touchscreen | Type a message           |
| Process | CPU (with help of RAM)       | Spell check, formatting  |
| Output  | Monitor, Printer, Email      | Display message or print |
| Storage | Hard Disk, USB, Google Drive | Save the document        |
