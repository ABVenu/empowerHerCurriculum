# Problem Solving Session (PSC)

**Total Duration:** 2 Hours

- **40 Minutes:** Forms Fundamentals
- **1 Hour 20 Minutes:** AI-Assisted Application Building

---

# Part 1: Forms Fundamentals (40 Minutes)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this segment, learners will be able to:

- Differentiate between **controlled** and **uncontrolled** components conceptually
- Explain why React prefers **controlled inputs**
- Bind input values to component state
- Handle **single-input forms** using state
- Manage **multiple inputs** using a single state object
- Perform **basic form submission** and read submitted values
- Prevent default browser form behavior during submission

---

## Instruction

- Use only `useState` for this segment
- Start with a **single input form**
- Progress to a **multiple input form**
- Demonstrate form submission using a button click or submit event
- Keep examples minimal and practical
- Do not introduce validation or advanced patterns

---

# Part 2: AI-Assisted Application Building (1 Hour 20 Minutes)

## Objective

Use an **AI tool** to scaffold a complete React application that applies all concepts learned so far, focusing on **structure, flow, and correctness**, not complexity.

---

## Instruction

### 1️⃣ Choose an AI Tool

Learners may use any AI-assisted tool capable of:

- Generating React project structure
- Creating components
- Setting up routing and basic state management

Examples include:

- AI code assistants
- Project scaffolding generators
- Chat-based AI tools

---

### 2️⃣ Define App Requirements (Before Generation)

The app must include:

- Multiple components
- Props passing between components
- State management using `useState`
- At least one form with controlled inputs
- Routing with at least:

  - Two routes
  - Navigation using Link or NavLink

- Conditional rendering
- Use of Context API for shared state (simple use case)
- Proper project folder structure

---

### 3️⃣ Use AI to Scaffold the Project

Learners should:

- Prompt the AI to generate a clean React project structure
- Ensure folders for:

  - Components
  - Pages
  - Context
  - Routes

- Review the generated structure before writing logic

---

### 4️⃣ Review and Refine the Generated Code

Learners must:

- Read and understand the AI-generated code
- Remove unused components or logic
- Rename components meaningfully
- Ensure routing and context usage are correct
- Verify forms work as expected

---

### 5️⃣ Instructor Guidance During Build

Instructor should:

- Help learners correct AI misuse
- Reinforce best practices
- Ensure learners understand **why code exists**
- Prevent blind copy–paste usage

---

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this PSC:

- Learners will have a **working React application**
- Learners will understand how AI can assist, not replace, thinking
- Learners will reinforce all React concepts covered so far
- Learners will gain confidence in building real applications

---

## Important Constraints

- Do not aim for feature completeness
- Focus on **clarity over complexity**
- AI is a **tool**, not the solution
- Understanding the generated structure is mandatory
