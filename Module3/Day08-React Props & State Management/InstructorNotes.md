# **Learning Objectives: React — Props & State Management**

## **Understand the Concept of Props**

* Explain what **props** are and why React uses them.
* Identify how data flows **one-way (parent → child)** in React.
* Pass props from a parent component to a child component.
* Use props inside functional components, including **destructuring**.
* Differentiate between **props** and **regular variables** inside components.

---

## **Use Props to Build Reusable Components**

* Create multiple components that accept props for titles, messages, and styles.
* Demonstrate how props help make components **dynamic and reusable**.
* Implement **default props** and understand when they are useful.

---

## **Understand State and When It Is Needed**

* Explain why React components need **internal data storage** (state).
* Identify real-world scenarios where state is required (counters, toggles, inputs).
* Compare **state vs props** clearly.

---

## **Use the `useState` Hook for Managing State**

* Initialize state using the `useState()` hook.
* Read and update state inside a component.
* Handle UI updates that depend on new state values (e.g., increment counter).
* Work with different state types: numbers, strings, booleans, and arrays.

---
## **Build Components only with State**
* Create a simple counter application, manage the count with useState
---
## **Build Components That Combine Props and State**
* Split that component into another one or two components, 
* Pass props to a component and manage part of its behavior through state.
* Lift state up when two sibling components need shared data.
* Identify when data should be stored as state vs passed as props.
