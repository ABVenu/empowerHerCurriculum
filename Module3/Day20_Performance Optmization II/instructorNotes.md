## Performance Optimization — II
# **Learning Objectives**

---

## **Review Core Performance Optimization Concepts**

* Recall the purpose of performance optimization in React.
* Reinforce understanding of re-rendering behavior.
* Revisit the role of `useMemo` and `useCallback` at a high level.

---

## **Understand Component Memoization with `React.memo` (Conceptual)**

* Explain what `React.memo` does.
* Understand how it prevents unnecessary re-renders of components.
* Identify scenarios where component memoization is useful.
* Recognize the dependency of `React.memo` on stable props.

---

## **Understand Lazy Loading (Conceptual)**

* Explain what lazy loading is.
* Understand how code splitting improves initial load performance.
* Identify common use cases such as:

  * Routes
  * Heavy components
* Understand lazy loading as a performance and user experience improvement.

---

## **Understand Key Optimization in Lists (Theory Only)**

* Explain the role of keys in list rendering.
* Understand how correct keys help React update lists efficiently.
* Identify performance issues caused by incorrect or unstable keys.

---

## **Understand Component Structuring for Performance (Theory Only)**

* Explain how large components cause wider re-renders.
* Understand how splitting components improves performance naturally.
* Connect component structure with maintainability and performance.

---

## **Understand Debouncing and Throttling (Theory Only)**

* Explain why some events fire too frequently.
* Understand debouncing as delaying execution.
* Understand throttling as limiting execution frequency.
* Identify scenarios where event control improves performance.

---

## **Understand Virtualization (Theory Only)**

* Explain why rendering large lists affects performance.
* Understand the concept of rendering only visible items.
* Identify real-world scenarios where virtualization is useful.

---

## **Understand React Strict Mode (Theory Only)**

* Explain what React Strict Mode is.
* Understand its purpose in detecting potential issues.
* Clarify that it affects development only, not production performance.

---

## **End-of-Session Expected Outcomes (Session II)**

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

* Explain how `React.memo` optimizes component rendering
* Describe how lazy loading improves performance
* Understand structural and theoretical performance optimizations
* Identify performance-related best practices beyond hooks
* Build awareness of advanced optimization techniques without implementation
